# **1. React Basics**  

#### **1.1 Introduction to React**  
**React** is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications. It focuses on a component-based architecture, making it easy to build reusable UI components.  
- **Key Features**:
  - **Declarative**: Describe what you want the UI to look like, and React handles the updates.
  - **Component-Based**: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state.
  - **Virtual DOM**: Efficient updates and rendering.
  - **Unidirectional Data Flow**: Data flows in one direction, making debugging easier.

**Example**:  
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

function App() {
  return <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;
}

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

**Interview Questions**:  
1. What is React, and why is it used?
2. What is the Virtual DOM, and how does it differ from the real DOM?

#### **1.2 JSX (JavaScript XML)**  
JSX is a syntax extension that looks like HTML, but it's used within JavaScript. It makes it easier to write UI elements declaratively.  

- **Rules of JSX**:
  1. Always return a single root element.
  2. Use `className` instead of `class`.
  3. Wrap expressions in `{}` for dynamic content.

**Example**:  
```jsx
const element = <h1>Welcome to React!</h1>;
const user = { firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Doe' };

const greeting = <p>Hello, {user.firstName} {user.lastName}!</p>;
```

**Interview Questions**:  
1. What is JSX, and why is it used in React?
2. Can a React component return multiple elements? How?

---

#### **1.3 Components**  
React components are the building blocks of a React application.  
- **Types of Components**:
  1. **Functional Components**: Simple functions that return JSX.
  2. **Class Components**: ES6 classes that include lifecycle methods.

**Functional Component Example**:  
```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}
```

**Class Component Example**:  
```jsx
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;
  }
}
```

**Interview Questions**:  
1. What are the differences between functional and class components?
2. How do you pass data between components?

---

#### **1.4 Props (Properties)**  
Props are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component. They are immutable.  

**Example**:  
```jsx
function Greeting(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}

// Usage
<Greeting name="Alice" />
```

**Interview Questions**:  
1. What are props in React?
2. How do you pass a function as a prop?

---

#### **1.5 State**  
State is an object that holds data or information about the component. Unlike props, state is mutable and managed within the component.

**Example**:  
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Interview Questions**:  
1. What is state in React, and how is it different from props?
2. How do you update state in a functional component?

---

#### **1.6 Event Handling**  
React handles events similarly to DOM elements, but with some syntactic differences.  

- **Example**:  
```jsx
function Button() {
  const handleClick = () => alert('Button clicked!');
  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>;
}
```

**Interview Questions**:  
1. How do you handle events in React?
2. What is the difference between `onClick` in React and vanilla JavaScript?

---

#### **1.7 Conditional Rendering**  
Render components or elements conditionally based on a certain condition.  

**Example**:  
```jsx
function Greeting({ isLoggedIn }) {
  return isLoggedIn ? <h1>Welcome back!</h1> : <h1>Please sign in.</h1>;
}
```

**Interview Questions**:  
1. What is conditional rendering, and how do you implement it?
2. What are some ways to render components conditionally?

---

#### **1.8 Lists and Keys**  
Rendering lists in React requires using the `map()` function, and each item needs a unique `key` prop for efficient updates.

**Example**:  
```jsx
const items = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry'];

function ItemList() {
  return (
    <ul>
      {items.map((item, index) => (
        <li key={index}>{item}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

**Interview Questions**:  
1. Why are `keys` important in React lists?
2. What happens if you don't use unique keys in a list?

# Learning React

### **1. React Basics**
- **Introduction to React**: What is React, its features, and benefits.
- **JSX**: Syntax and rules.
- **Components**: Functional and class components.
- **Props**: Passing data between components.
- **State**: Managing component-specific data with `useState`.
- **Event Handling**: Handling events like clicks, form submissions, etc.
- **Conditional Rendering**: `if`, ternary, and logical operators for rendering.
- **Lists and Keys**: Rendering lists and using unique keys.

---

### **2. Intermediate React Concepts**
- **React Lifecycle Methods**: Component lifecycle in class components and hooks (`useEffect`).
- **Forms**: Controlled vs. uncontrolled components.
- **Hooks**:
  - `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, `useContext`, `useReducer`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`.
- **Context API**: Global state management.
- **Error Boundaries**: Handling errors in React components.
- **Fragments, Portals, and StrictMode**.

### **3. Advanced React Concepts**
- **Higher-Order Components (HOC)**: Reusing component logic.
- **Render Props**: Sharing functionality between components.
- **React Router**: Navigation and routing in single-page applications.
- **React Performance**:
  - Optimizing renders with `React.memo`.
  - Using `useCallback` and `useMemo` effectively.
  - Avoiding unnecessary re-renders.
- **Code Splitting**: Lazy loading with `React.lazy` and `Suspense`.
- **Custom Hooks**: Creating reusable hooks for logic abstraction.
- **React Concurrent Mode**: Concepts like `useTransition` and `useDeferredValue`.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Using Next.js for rendering React apps on the server.
- **State Management Libraries**:
  - Redux (basic to toolkit).
  - Context API with Reducers.
  - Zustand or MobX as alternatives.

### **4. Practical Applications**
- Building projects to solidify your understanding:
  - **Simple Counter App**.
  - **To-Do List** with local storage.
  - **E-Commerce App** with React Router and Context API.
  - **Portfolio Website** using components and hooks.
  - **Blog Website** with APIs and CRUD functionality.

### **5. Interview-Specific Preparation**
- **React Core Questions**:
  - Differences between `state` and `props`.
  - What are hooks? Why do we use them?
  - Explain `useEffect` lifecycle behavior.
  - Performance optimization techniques in React.
- **Code Challenges**:
  - Implement a custom hook.
  - Build a small feature like a search bar or modal.
  - Debugging React code.
- **Behavioral Questions**:
  - How would you optimize a slow React app?
  - Share your experience with state management.
